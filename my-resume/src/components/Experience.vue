                Yokogawa is responsible for industrial automation, test and
                measurement solutions. They provide everything for measuring and
                monitoring of factories. For this project, they wanted an
                application that gives insight into all the data that is being
                collected. Oscar was solely responsible for building and
                implementing the frontend application that gives insight into
                the collected data from different applications. This was created
                in React. Another project was creating the interface of the
                application that collected the data of different sensors and
                measuring systems.
